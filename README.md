👋 Hi, I’m Evan.

I build products and systems at the intersection of software, growth, and execution.

🔧 What I’m working on
• Online Growth Suite — building conversion-focused websites and growth systems for service businesses & clinics
• SuperLinkedIn — a tool to help founders and consultants understand their audience and grow on LinkedIn (relaunching)

🧠 How I think
• Ship fast, then iterate with real users
• Bottlenecks > ideas — progress comes from removing constraints
• Prefer leverage and systems over one-off wins

📍 Currently based in Boston
